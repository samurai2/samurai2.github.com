## What are the pros and cons with Cloud Computing?

Service providers are responsible for installing and maintaining core technology within the cloud. Some customers prefer this model because it limits their own manageability burden. However, customers cannot directly control system stability in this model and are highly dependent on the provider instead.  This can open up all sorts of security issues if they are not configured correctly.Cloud computing systems are normally designed to closely track all system resources, which enables providers to charge customers according to the resources each consumes. Some customers will prefer this so-called metered billing approach to save money, while others will prefer a flat-rate subscription to ensure predictable monthly or yearly costs.Using a cloud computing environment generally requires you to send data over the Internet and store it on a third-party system. The privacy and security risks associated with this model must be weighed against alternatives. This CTF exposes and educates players on the issues that can occur with a typical cloud computing environment.
