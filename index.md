Welcome to the new version of the OpenCTF Samurai CTF.  This CTF focuses heavily on a Cloud based infrastructure and the issues that can occur with it.  Each player is given their own Cloud instance and the associated vulnerabilities that exist in a cloud based world. Each environment consists of one web server and one database server.  The main application that is used in this CTF is a stock trading platform made for day traders.

This CTF was built for beginner to intermediate players who want to get some CTF experience.
