<p>
Welcome to the new version of the Samurai CTF.  This CTF focuses heavily on a Cloud based infrastructure and the issues or vulnerabilities that can occur with a typical cloud based environment.  Each player is given their own Cloud instance and the associated vulnerabilities that exist in an imperfect cloud based world. Each environment consists of one web application server and one backend database server.  The main application  in this CTF is a stock trading platform made for day traders.  This is not a typical CTF type challenge, this is a fully functioning stock trading application built on an enterprise platform based on the MVC architecture.  This gives the CTF a realworld experience, you can't get any closer than this!
<br/>
This CTF was built for small and medium sized events.  Scoring is done in realtime to create a dynamic environment that gives way to fluid game play.  Think you might get stuck?  Don't worry we put in some hints to help you on your way!
